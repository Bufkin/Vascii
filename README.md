A simple Python client-server application that allows you to convert a webcam stream to ASCII and exchange video streams with someone else, like a video chat in ASCII.
This tool can also be used to stream your webcam into your local terminal as ASCII.
This could help test a webcam through an SSH connection. Hackers?
